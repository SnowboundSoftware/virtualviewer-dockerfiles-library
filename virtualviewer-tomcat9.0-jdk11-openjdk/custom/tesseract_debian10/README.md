# Tesseract Binaries

These tesseract binaries are our unofficial build from source. We compile on Debian 10 (AMD64) which uses `libc6 2.28-10 amd64`. We (Snowbound) have made no modifications to the source. These binaries are installed when building our VirtualViewer Docker image. The version of tess4j that RasterMaster uses requires this version.
